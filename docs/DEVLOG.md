# Devlog

Loop started 2026-08-06. Task: reusable card-game foundation (see CHARTER.md).
Pre-approved, unattended — implementer is DeepSeek CLI, reviewer is an Opus
sub-agent (user's explicit routing override for this run).

## Cycle 1 — 2026-08-06/07
- **Shipped:** M0 — `src/card-engine/{cards,deck,rng}.ts` + tests, vitest wired
  up as the project's test runner (commit `0447171`).
- **Verification:** re-ran `npx tsc -b --noEmit`, `npm test`, `npm run build`
  myself after DeepSeek's report, not just read its output. Read every source
  file line by line against the spec (exact match).
- **Review:** Opus sub-agent ran genuinely adversarial checks (60k-op
  conservation fuzz, byte-for-byte RNG comparison, chi-square fairness/
  uniformity tests, 12 mutation tests). Verdict: implementation correct, but
  the *tests* were weak — a biased Fisher-Yates (`j = rand*i` instead of
  `rand*(i+1)`) and an RNG algorithm drift would both pass the original 30
  tests. Fixed with a permutation-frequency fairness test and a golden-value
  RNG test.
- **Incident:** the golden RNG value I sourced from the review report for the
  fix spec was wrong in its 3rd digit-string (`0.5766275967937894` — does not
  match any deterministic continuation of the verified-correct first two
  values). DeepSeek caught this itself mid-task by re-deriving the value
  empirically through the real toolchain rather than trusting the spec's
  literal number, used the correct value, and flagged the discrepancy in its
  report. I independently re-verified with a fresh `node -e` before accepting
  either number. **Lesson:** even a review-report's own stated evidence needs
  independent re-verification before it's baked into a downstream spec as a
  "given" constant — one more link in the chain, one more chance for drift.
- **Incident:** the fix-spec's mutation-test step (deliberately break the
  shuffle, confirm the new test fails, revert) hit DeepSeek's 25-tool-round
  session cap mid-step and returned with `deck.ts` left in the **deliberately
  broken** state (`git status` showed it untracked, so `git diff` against HEAD
  showed nothing — the danger of verifying an uncommitted new module). Caught
  by reading the file directly rather than trusting "task complete." Fixed by
  hand, then independently reproduced the mutation-catches-the-bug proof
  myself (break it, confirm 1 test fails as expected, revert, confirm 32/32
  green again) before committing. **Lesson:** commit a new module right after
  its first successful independent verification, *before* dispatching any
  follow-up work against it — an untracked multi-file diff is much harder to
  audit for "did the last task actually leave this clean" than a tracked one.
- **Continue?** Yes — on track, M0 solid, M1 spec already drafted and locked
  in scratch, ready to dispatch next cycle.
